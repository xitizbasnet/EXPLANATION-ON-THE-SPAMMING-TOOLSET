EXPLANATION ON THE SPAMMING TOOLSET

•CPanel
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The CPanel is the backbone of Spamming, we simply use the CPanel to host our scampage for it to be visible online...
Without a CPanel, we won’t be able to host our scampage. 
Every cpanel must come with HTTPS for it to be secured, so browsers won’t block the scampage from being visible to our victims... 
My CPanel lasts for a month.

•MAILER AND SMTP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
A Mailer is a software for sending massive mails to our mailist. Without the use of mailer and SMTP, we won’t be able to send our scam letter to our mailist. Getting a good mailer and SMTP is very important... 
Without the SMTP, we won’t be able to send mails, the SMTP influences the destination of our mail whether it gets delivered to the spam folder of our victims or their inbox. 
The SMTP enables us to be able to send mails using our mailer.

•EMAIL VERIFIER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Making use of email verifier is really important while spamming...
It simply verifies our email addresses and filters the bad ones from the valid ones... 
Sending mails without verifying the email addresses would damage the SMTP server.

•SCAMPAGES AND LETTERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
A Scampage is the replication of an original site page. For example if you wanna spam PayPal Logs, you’ll get a PayPal scampage which is a clone of the original PayPal site, so our victim won’t know the difference...

•SCAMLETTER 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Scamletter is the email being sent to our victims’ mailist, so when they open their email and see our scamletter, it would look real to them, and when they click on it, they’ll be redirected to your Scampage.
